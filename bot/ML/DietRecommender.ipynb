Bitter and astringent tastes are beneficial, offering cooling effects for Pitta, lightening for Kapha, and drying for both doshas. Opt for low-sugar fruits like apples, blueberries, and cherries, while avoiding fruit juice. Incorporate bitter or astringent vegetables like asparagus (Shatavri) and celery, favoring lighter whole grains such as amaranth (Ragjira) and millet. Choose lighter, cooling oils like ghee and sunflower oil in moderation. Integrate warming digestive spices such as ginger and turmeric, limiting salt intake and sweeteners. Dairy should be limited to ghee, homemade kefir, yogurt, and goat dairy. Drink ginger tea, CCF Tea (cumin, coriander, and fennel tea), or warm lime water between meals to aid digestion. Consider taking Triphala Churna, Bhumyamalaki, or Amalaki before bed to support digestion, elimination, and detoxification.',\n",

Avoid grazing and snacking. Avoid eating after 7pm (6pm in winter). Avoid iced and cold beverages. Avoid drinking fluids before, during, or directly after meals. Avoid heavy grains such as wheat, gluten, and oats. Avoid fatty foods, fried foods, unhealthy oils, and excessive oil. Avoid processed food, additives, and dyes. Avoid improper food combinations.',\n",
       " 'Consume a diet rich in cooling, non-spicy foods to pacify both Pitta and Kapha. Engage in regular, moderate exercise such as swimming or brisk walking to balance both doshas. Incorporate stress-reducing practices like meditation or deep breathing to maintain emotional equilibrium. Maintain regular meal times and avoid overeating to support digestion and prevent Pitta-Kapha imbalance. Stay hydrated with room temperature or cool water to cool Pitta without aggravating Kapha. Include bitter and astringent tastes in your diet to pacify excess Kapha and Pitta. Create a calm, peaceful environment for relaxation and quality sleep to balance both doshas. Minimize exposure to heated environments or situations to prevent Pitta aggravation. Engage in activities that promote mental and emotional balance, such as journaling or creative pursuits. Seek guidance from an Ayurvedic practitioner for personalized recommendations tailored to your unique constitution.']"
